						<h1>StayHealthy iOS Documentation</h1>

<p>StayHealthy is a fitness training application for both iOS and Android devices. StayHealthy focuses on the simplicity of accessing what you need when you are in the gym. StayHealthy provides users with a huge selection of strength, stretching, and warmup exercises as well as workouts hand crafted by professional trainers. StayHealthy also offers a wide selection of features such as creating custom workouts, advanced search methods, and the ability to &ldquo;like&rdquo; both workouts and exercises. StayHealthy keeps track of you when you need it to with iCloud, making sure that all your data and custom workouts are synced to all of your devices. I am excited to continue to grow StayHealthy to become one of the best fitness applications on the AppStore with so much planned for the future.</p>
