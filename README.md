## Personal

For a long time, I have been self-conscious of my body and wanted to create an application that would help me and other people in a similar situation become less self-conscious. So, I began to write StayHealthy Fitness using Objective-C. I had prior experience writing iOS applications in Objective-C but StayHealthy is particularly special to me. StayHealthy is designed using the model view controller design pattern and relies on Core Data to store the userâ€™s data and a SQLite database to store the exercises and workouts. Internally, I implemented a singleton class that acts as the controller to all the models which individually represent a Core Data entity. To display exercise and workout images I utilized multiple different threads to load them asynchronously to make the user interface transition between views better. StayHealthy is something I am very proud of and it challenged me immensely at times, see the final product [here.](http://www.stayhealthy.io/)
